Hi, I am Trevor, a full-stack software engineer based out of Toronto, Canada.

I spend most of my time building back-end systems with [Rust][rust] and front-ends with [React][react]. Since I started professionally building software, I have worked mostly on integration platforms that enable systems to exchange data with each other; initially, in the healthcare space with [HL7][hl7] and [FHIR][fhir], and more recently in the financial space with REST APIs.

I do have some open-source projects which are listed on my [Projects][projects] page, but otherwise, like to spend time jamming on [Advent of Code][aoc], or picking up books to learn new concepts and programming languages.

When I am not coding, I like to spend time with my family, build Lego, and go to the gym.
