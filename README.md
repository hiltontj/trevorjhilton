# trevorjhilton.com

This is the code repository for my website [trevorjhilton.com](https://trevorjhilton.com). It is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/).

## Development

On MacOS, with Zola installed (see how to install Zola on MacOS [here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/#macos)), you can run:

```
zola serve
```

This will host the site locally at `localhost:1111`.
